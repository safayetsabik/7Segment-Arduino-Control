# 7-Segment Display Control with Arduino
Collaborative Arduino project by A M Safayet Hossain and Shuvra Dev.

This Arduino sketch is a basic example of controlling a 7-segment display. The code demonstrates how to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and displays the results on a 7-segment display. This code includes predefined values for illustrating arithmetic operations. You can modify the code to take user input or adapt it for various projects. This serves as a foundational code for learning and customization in controlling 7-segment displays with Arduino.

Feel free to adjust or expand on this as needed!
